# Accupar LAI calculator

This piece of code reads the .xls spreadsheet downloaded from the Accupar LP-80, calculated per sample (BLW) LAI and recalculates LAI for the average (SUM) data type and outputs it as a CSV file. The calculation is the same as internal calculation of the LP-80. This code is useful for those who are seeking to know the distribution of their LAI data, rather than just an average.

Below is the downloaded spreadsheet from the device:
